## Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository contains comprehensive Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms, focusing on both regression and classification tasks. Each model is accompanied by code, and minimal explanations, aimed at developers and data scientists who want to quickly reference or apply these algorithms in their own projects. The repository is structured to showcase how each algorithm is trained, used for prediction, and evaluated for performance.

### Contents:

1. **Linear Models**:
    - **Simple Linear Regression**: Implements linear regression for predicting a single continuous target variable.
    - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extends linear regression to multiple input variables.
    - **Polynomial Regression**: Demonstrates non-linear data modeling using polynomial features.
    - **L1 Regression (Lasso)**: Applies Lasso regression with L1 regularization for feature selection and shrinkage.
    - **L2 Regression (Ridge)**: Uses Ridge regression with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
    - **Elastic Net Regression**: Combines L1 and L2 regularization to balance between feature selection and shrinkage.
    - **Principal Component Regression (PCR)**: Reduces dimensionality using PCA before regression.

2. **Classification Models**:
    - **Logistic Regression**: A fundamental classifier for binary classification tasks.
    - **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning method for classification.
    - **Decision Tree Classifier**: A tree-structured model for making sequential decisions in classification tasks.
    - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that finds the hyperplane maximizing the margin between classes.
    - **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem for independent features.

3. **Ensemble Learning**:
    - **Bagging**: A method for building multiple independent models and averaging their predictions.
    - **Random Forest**: An extension of bagging using decision trees to improve classification or regression tasks.
    - **Voting Classifier (Hard, Soft Voting)**: Combines multiple models to make a decision based on majority vote or averaged probabilities.
    - **Stacking**: A meta-learning technique that combines multiple models and trains a meta-model for better predictions.
    - **Boosting Models**:
        - **AdaBoost**: Sequentially trains weak learners, with a focus on correcting mistakes from previous iterations.
        - **Gradient Boosting**: Builds trees to minimize residual errors sequentially.
        - **XGBoost**: An optimized and regularized implementation of gradient boosting for faster performance and improved accuracy.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Each model includes performance metrics such as:
        - **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
        - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true vs predicted values.
        - **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for classification models.

5. **Visualization**:
    - For each classification model, the decision boundaries are visualized for better understanding of how the model separates classes.
